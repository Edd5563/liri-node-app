//Errors encountered with Twitter NPM//
Duringtwiiter set up i may have requested to many requests while i called my program to work out bugs.

i got this error
{ errors: [ { code: 89, message: 'Invalid or expired token.' } ] }


I even remade my app key just incase it was because i did to many but with new keys it still did not work.



when i switch the screen_name to q i get this

TypeError: Cannot read property 'length' of undefined
